Fireball War
By Sam Von Ehren
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the Crafty Game Engine(craftyjs.com) and the SpriteText module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES:
The controls are simple, player 1 uses "A" to shoot fireballs and "W"
to jump. Player 2 uses "K" to shoot fireballs and "I" to jump. When a
player gets hit with a fireball, they are continually bounced back. Once one
player is knocked off the screen, they lose.
