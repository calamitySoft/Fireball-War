Fireball War

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the Crafty Game Engine(craftyjs.com) and the SpriteText module.
I've been working on it as part of my "Game Sketches" project. You
can find out more about it on my blog gamesketches.wordpress.com
If you'd like to work on some projects or something, shoot me an email!

RULES:
The controls are simple, player 1 uses "A" to shoot fireballs and "W"
to jump. Player 2 uses "K" to shoot fireballs and "I" to jump. When a
player gets hit with a fireball, they are continually bounced back. Once one
player is knocked off the screen, they lose.
